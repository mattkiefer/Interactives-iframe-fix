            I embedded Apple Music's teaser for Kendrick Lamar's halftime show announcing guest artist SZA. It supports the story by letting the readers see for themselves what the reveal looked like and build excitement. 
            Embedding this video was pretty simple, but I noticed that some videos were restricted by the author (like NFL) to be embedded onto other websites, so I tried to find something that would be easy to view right on the page.
